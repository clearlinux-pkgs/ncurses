Subject: [PATCH] Avoid checking for existence of /usr/lib64/pkgconfig

At time of this writing (2022-02-24), the ncurses buildroot does not
contain any installed packages with pkgconfig files, so the
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig does not exist.

During the staged install, it *will* exist, so we don't need configure's
existence check here.
